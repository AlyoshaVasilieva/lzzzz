# Lzzzz
Yet another liblz4 binding ðŸ˜´

- **Designed for Rust:** Lzzzz is a high-level wrapper of liblz4 provides comprehensible API complies with Rust's manner without losing performance and flexibility. You have no concern about memory management and concurrency safety.

- **Various Modes:** `LZ4`, `LZ4_HC`, `LZ4F`, `LZ4 Streaming`, `LZ4_HC Streaming` and `LZ4F Streaming` are supported.

- **Flexible Streaming:** All the compressor/decompressor streams support `Read`, `BufRead` and `Write` operations. 
With `tokio` feature, `AsyncRead`, `AsyncBufRead` and `AsyncWrite` are also supported.

- LZ4 Block Compression/Decompression
- LZ4 Streaming Compression/Decompression (Reader/Writer)
- LZ4_HC Block Compression
- LZ4_HC Streaming Compression (Reader/Writer)
- LZ4F Compression/Decompression
- LZ4F Streaming Compression/Decompression (Reader/Writer)


## Features

- **"tokio-io" :** Add `AsyncRead`, `AsyncBufRead` and `AsyncWrite` support for streams.
- **"lz4-use-stack" :** (Enabled by default) Use the stack allocation for the LZ4 compressor stream.
Disabling this future may resolve stack overflow errors.
- **"lz4hc-use-stack" :** Use the stack allocation for the LZ4_HC compressor stream. 
Enabling this future may cause stack overflow errors with the default stack size configuration.
